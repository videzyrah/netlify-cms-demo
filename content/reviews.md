      Raisin brand doesn't quite compare to Kellogg's Raisin Bran.  The money
      saved isn't worth the disappointment, even when I mix it with brand name
      Cheerios (my standard practice).

      The fake Life isn't terrible when your broke, but better just to wait for the BOGO sale on the real thing.
    name: Publix generic cereals (raisin brand, cheerios, life).

  - details: For $0.69 it's not bad maybe once  or twice a month when you're too
      hungry or tired to do any prep/wait for water to boil.
    name: Aldi canned macaroni and beef

  - details: They all suck.  As a rule of thumb, read the heating instructions on
      the back of any frozen dinners before buying.  Anything that says
      something like "remove the brownie, then heat, then replace brownie, heat
      some more" is annoying and will get you a mix of burning hot and freezing
      cold food. Also anything with a separate mashed potatoes compartment is
      generally lame.

Welcome to my awesome reviews of grocery store products.

If you are like me and tend to forget whether or not you liked certain varieties of items when they go on sale (or when you make a trip to not your usual grocery store) hopefully this will help you.
